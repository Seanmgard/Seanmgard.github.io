    "text": "Each year, ESPN ranks the top 300 high school football recruits in the country. Players are evaluated on a variety of metrics to determine how they compare vs. their peers by state, position, and across the nation. These lists are usually a great indicator of how impactful players are for their varsity team. For example, Malachi Nelson, the #1 ranked player in the class of 2023, passed for 2,898 yards and 35 touchdowns this past season. Next year he’ll be attending the University of Southern California (USC), where fans and analysts will be evaluating whether he’s the next future NFL star. We’ve seen plenty of examples of that in recent history. Just five years ago, Justin Fields and Trevor Lawrence, now rising QBs in the NFL, ranked as the number 1 and number 2 players in the class of 2018.\nAs I mentioned, the top 300 list is meant to reflect how talented players are at a given point in time. But how well does it predict future success? One would think recruiting grades correlate well with eventual draft likelihood, but is that actually the case? Furthermore, do those trends hold across all positions? In this analysis, I set out to start answering those questions.\nFirst, we need to gather all the necessary data. I initially built a web scraper in Python to pull data for the top high school football recruits between 2006 and 2023 from ESPN.com. I used the pandas library to read the HTML tables on each webpage, clean the data, and extract it to a separate excel file. I then ran some simple excel functions to combine that dataset with the nflverse-data repository on Github. From that, we were left with a list that contains 4,350 players. I then used ggplot2 in R to run the analysis below.\n\nRanking Successful Players\nLet’s start with a general view of all draftees, and how they ranked in high school. This table outlines the high school ranking of each player that was drafted between 2009 and 2023. This list only includes draftees that were ranked in high school, and you may be surprised to learn that most draft picks in any given year weren’t ranked among the top 150 players of their recruiting class. With the subset of players that were, in fact, ranked that high, we see that those ranked in the top 50 did indeed have a higher likelihood of being drafted than those ranked lower. That said, beyond the top 50, those differences become far less pronounced.\n\nThe first takeaway here may be that truly top talents are easy to evaluate from an early age, but measuring performance beyond that point becomes more difficult. The dynamic is even more interesting if we break things down by position.\n\nA few interesting themes emerge here. First, skill positions like WR tend to comprise a meaningful selection of the top ESPN recruits each year. This makes sense if we think about the depth chart of any given football team. Unlike many other positions (ex: FB), there will often be 2-4 receivers on the field at a time, which makes the position itself that much more valuable.\nThat said, we still see some interesting dynamics within positions. Prior to this analysis, my hypothesis was that certain positions may have a higher likelihood of being drafted after ranking highly in high school than others. Instead, the themes across each of these are relatively consistent. I suppose this makes sense too. Think for a moment about five of the top QBs in the league at this moment (Patrick Mahomes, Jalen Hurts, Joe Burrow, Josh Allen, and Justin Herbert). Of those players, only Joe Burrow was ranked among the Top 300 high school recruits coming into college, and he ranked 298th. It’s hard to predict these things.\n\n\nTalent Evaluation by School\nI was also curious whether the colleges these recruits were choosing were any better at picking future NFL draft picks than others. The chart below outlines the number of high school recruits that committed to each school over the same time period mentioned above and excludes any schools that did not recruit at least 25 top 300 players. In general, powerhouse schools like Alabama, Georgia, and LSU recruited significantly more top-rated players than other schools.\n\nBefore making any conclusions from this data set, I think it’s important to note a few important factors here. 1.) Some schools may have better systems and development programs than others, which can significantly impact a recruit’s ability to reach the NFL. 2.) Some schools may pass on clear-cut future NFL stars due to their existing depth chart. An obvious example can be found in 2018. It was not in the interest of the teams or players for one school to receive commits from both Justin Fields and Trevor Lawrence. Various situational dynamics have existed over the past several years like this. Beyond that, it’s also often in the interest of an incoming recruit to choose a school where he’s more likely to make an immediate impact, rather than waiting behind a stacked Alabama roster. 3.) This list is based on the schools that players committed to, not the schools they attended when they were drafted. For example, Cam Newton is technically listed as a recruit of ‘Florida’ in this dataset, rather than Auburn, where he won a Heisman and a national championship. While some interesting exploration can be done on that data, I wanted to isolate any transfer-portal related dynamics, so that we can evaluate a school’s ability to choose recruits.\nLastly, it’s also just worth mentioning that schools don’t definitively choose their recruits. They extend offers to athletes, who then have the choice of choosing from a selection of different schools. Perhaps in a future analysis, we can investigate a more detailed dataset that includes “offers extended” from each school, rather than just “offers accepted.”\nFrom the table above, we can see that the data doesn’t necessarily show any clear trends. While schools like Alabama and Georgia generated more future NFL draft picks than other schools, they also tended to recruit more Top 150 high school players. In other words, their ability to choose and develop future NFL talent isn’t necessarily higher than their peers on a relative basis. A notable exception seems to be Texas, who generates a significantly lower % of drafted players than its peers.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis dataset may confirm some priors about high school recruiting and perhaps dispel some notions about talent evaluation in football. Here are some takeaways:\n1.) There is a correlation between a player’s high school ranking and their likelihood of being drafted. That said, the correlation decreases for players ranked outside the top 50.\n2.) There isn’t a clear theme between a player’s position and their likelihood of being drafted. There are certainly more WRs drafted than say, ILBs, but there are also more WRs among the top ranked players to begin with.\n3.) There isn’t a clear trend in talent evaluation among the top schools. Powerhouse schools attract more top recruits, and as we know, those players have a higher likelihood of being drafted. But the percentage of players drafted across the top ~20 schools is consistent.\nThis is part 1 of an ongoing series where I analyze the high school recruit to NFL draft pick pipeline. In the future, I hope to expand this dataset and continue investigating trends among players and schools."

    "title": "A Review of Employment Data (March 2023)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "On March 9th, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released its Job Openings and Labor Turnover report (also known as \"JOLTS\") for January 2023. The report noted a slight decline in the number of job openings for the month, largely driven by construction, accommodation and food services, and finance and insurance.\nThe following day, we received the Employment Situation, which showed that non-farm payroll rose by 311,000 for the month of February, with the unemployment rate (3.6%) and unemployed persons (5.9 million) rising as more people entered the labor force. This comes alongside a plethora of other reports, along with commentary from market analysts, who are trying to project where the employment situation might go.\nWe live in an interesting era, where traditional employment tells conflicting stories. That data can even be bolstered, or contradicted, by ongoing data released from companies like LinkedIn and Indeed. While data from those sites may paint a less comprehensive picture, it still provides helpful insight on the overall macroeconomic situation. It also causes confusion when there are gaps in methodologies, timing, and economic metrics that tell varying stories.\n\nWhat does the data show?\nFirst, let’s look at some of the employment metrics. I’ve broken the data based on the various reports and tried to tie the threads together where applicable. Let’s start with the ADP Employment Report.\n\nAt a national level, ADP nonfarm payrolls rose by 242,000, beating estimates of 200,000. That said, as Pantheon Macro noted on Wednesday, ADP developed a new methodology for their employment calculations in August of 2022, and has only released 6 payroll numbers since then. Of those, four have undershot official payrolls. We still don’t know whether that trend will hold, of course, but it’s important to remember these estimates can be inconsistent.\nFurther data from the report shows a more nuanced picture.\n\nThe chart above shows the week-to-week change in private employment by industry since mid-2021. In the month of February, job growth was led, in part, by growth in financial activities (+62,000) and manufacturing (+43,000). Not shown in the chart above is Leisure and Hospitality, which also showed job growth of +83,000 as well. Beyond that, education and health services (+35,000), natural resources and mining (+25,000), and other services (+34,000) showed growth. Declines were observed in professional and business services (-36,000) and construction (-16,000). Net- Overall employment seems to be positive, though there is some underlying weakness below the surface. This becomes clearer if we break the report down by size of business.\nPositive trends were driven entirely by businesses with more than 50+ employees. Small businesses (those with 19 or less employees) saw employment contract by -56,000 in the month of February. On the opposite end of the spectrum, employment by businesses larger than 500 employees grew by +160,000.\n\nThis has been the theme in private employment going back to the start of 2022. Since then, businesses with 50-249 employees have seen the largest growth (~2.3 million jobs added), while those with 1-19 employees have consistently reduced employment over the past 12 periods of data (-577,000 jobs lost).\nNext, let’s look at the JOLTS report from last Wednesday. Here, we saw the number of job openings decrease in January, as reported by the BLS. Though the data here lags the ADP Report by about a month, similar themes emerged as job openings in construction (-240,000) and finance + insurance (-100,000) contributed to the decline in overall openings (-410,000). Some increases were observed in areas like services (+95,000) and trade, transportation, and utilities (+51,000). In general, these declines were observed primarily in the West and Midwest.\n\n\nLooking at total separations, quits declined to 2.5%, down from 2.6% the month prior, while layoffs and discharges were relatively stable at 1.1%. The decline in quits was primarily driven by Professional and business services, which fell from 719,000 in December to 498,000 in January. Similarly, layoffs and discharges increased by +191,000 in January to 1.7 million, up from ~1.5 million in December. This was again largely due to negative dynamics among professional and business services workers. Some have said these trends are indicative of continued labor market cooling, but outside of professional and business services, shifts have been very slow.\nHiring and separations in the JOLTS report seems to differ vs. some of the trends observed in the ADP Employment Report, though again, there is a difference in the time periods measured. Businesses with 1-9 employees have shown the strongest growth over the past few months, up +68,000 since October 2022. While total private employment is up over that same time frame (+251,000), businesses with 50-249 have driven most of that, with an increase of +129,000. What sticks out from this dataset is the change in job openings over the same period. Businesses with 1-9 employees increased openings by +355,000, while businesses with 50-249 employees were relatively flat. Businesses with 250-999 employees reduced hiring by -159,000. This will be a trend worth monitoring.\n\nAs mentioned at the beginning, the release of the Employment Situation for February 2023 showed an increase in the unemployment rate, as more people entered the labor force. Here, the data shows a bit of a mixed story. For those looking for signs of labor market cooling, we see some examples of softening in areas like average hourly wages, hours worked, and the overall unemployment rate. That said, we still see moderate growth, with little sign of an increase in the rate of cooling on the horizon. Leisure and hospitality led the increase in employment, adding +105,000 jobs in February, along with Food services, which added +70,000 jobs, and retail trade, which rose +50,000.\nWhile it’s difficult to draw strong conclusions about this report, there are still some interesting themes in the data. First, the unemployment rate has differed among different ages and levels of educational attainment. Since February 2022, the unemployment rate for those with less than a high school diploma, a group that admittedly only makes up ~6% of the total labor force, has significantly increased from 4.5% in January to 5.8% in February. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has stayed relatively stagnant for high school graduates without a degree and those with a bachelor’s degree or higher, though it did increase from 2.9 to 3.2% for those with some college or associate degree.\n Differences emerge if we look specifically at age as well. Since February of 2022, unemployment has remained steady for most age cohorts except for those aged 35 to 44 years old, which has seen a decrease in the unemployment rate from 3.3% to 2.6%, and 55 years and over, which has seen a decline in the unemployment rate from 2.9% to 2.5%. We’ve even seen some interesting movements since just last month.\n\nThe unemployment rate for those aged 16 to 17 years old has declined from 10.9% to 9.0%, while it climbed to 12.1% from 10.0% for those aged 18 to 19 years old. This is likely driven by some movements in the labor force participation rate, which saw a significant decline for the former cohort, and a significant rise for the latter. That said, trends have been steady overall for most of the prime age working population.\n\n\nHow do these results square with other miscellaneous sources?\nIt’s mixed! On March 6th, LinkedIn released its Workforce Report for March 2023, which outlined some interesting trends. In general, the report showed substantial declines in hiring (-6.5%), which was the largest seen since April 2020. This marked the 10th consecutive month of declines, bringing the overall Y-Y hiring decline to -27.9%. Industries like Real Estate (+4%), Education (+2%), and Accommodation (+1%) showed the strongest month-to-month increases, while Manufacturing (-10%), Technology, Information, and Media (-10%), and Construction (-9%) showed the largest declines. The LinkedIn hiring rate looks at the number of hires divided by LinkedIn membership. While it may not necessarily be predictive, it still provides another helpful data point for employment. Most industries have declined since last year, though Tech (-47), Professional Services (-31), and Holding Companies (-31) lead the charge.\n\n\nIndeed also tries to monitor employment opportunities through its ‘Job Postings Index’. The index is set to 100 for February 2020 and uses a 7-day moving average to monitor employment opportunities. This data shows a significant decline over the past few months.\n\n\n\nSummary\nWe have conflicting data from various sources, but overall, the labor market seems resilient with some underlying cracks below the surface. The Fed seems to be chipping away at employment to bring inflation down, but the process so far has been slow. If I had to make a prediction, I think we will continue to see the Fed raise rates to ~5.5-6% by the end of the year. There are whispers of coming layoffs among larger companies, particularly in industries like tech and consulting, so my expectation is an unemployment rate around 4.5-5% by the end of the year, with uneven impacts across different age and educational cohorts."
