My name is Sean Gardner. I'm an Associate Manager of Forecasting at a market research firm, where I specialize in modeling new product innovations for major CPG brands. I graduated from Indiana University in 2019, where I studied Economics and Strategic Interaction.

I have a passion for data and wanted to set up some space where I can post about things I've been working on in my free time. I want this to be a space where I can keep track of my progress in data visualization and modeling, and hopefully learn from anyone that knows more about these topics.
